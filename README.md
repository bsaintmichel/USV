# USV processing 

This programme processes ultrasound speckles (`Speckle_XXX.dat`) and config files (`config.mat`) based on Thomas Gallot's / Vincent Grenard's / SÃ©bastien Manneville's scripts. 

There are four main programmes here : 

* `Process.ipynb` processes the data, including :
  * Making a Reference (using Numpy)
  * Beamforming (using Pytorch)
  * Computing the Hilbert transform to get the signal intensity (using Pytorch)
  * Computing the Displacements using cross-correlations (using Torchaudio)
  * Computes the velocity (using Numpy) if a calibration is provided

* `Benchmark.ipynb` provides side-by side comparisons between old and new data processing
* `Plot.ipynb` plots the data
* `Calib.ipynb` creates a calibration file that will be used to compute the velocity

The code will benefit from CUDA capabilities (x5 to x10 in terms of processing speed)

## Install

Install the dependencies (using `pip`) if you _do_ have a CUDA GPU : 

```
    pip install -r requirements_cuda.txt
```

Otherwise if you _don't_ have a CUDA GPU : 

```
    pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt
```
